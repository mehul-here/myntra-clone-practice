I finally completed the 20-hour React tutorial by **Prashant Sir** and built the full **Myntra clone project** as shown in the video.

You can check out the project by following these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the main project folder.
2. Navigate to the `node-backend` folder and run `npm install`, then `npm start` to start the backend server.
3. Open another terminal, navigate to the `myntra` folder, run `npm install`, and then `npm run dev` to start the frontend.
4. A localhost link will appear in the terminal — open it in your browser to view the project.

And that’s it!
